# ARC
## This is a repository containing all of the data materials I used when writing my thesis and designing the web tool for visualizaiton. My thesis generally covers a redesign of Agricultural Risk Coverage - County, or ARC-Co, a U.S. farm policy commodity support program. The two redesign options are called Enhanced ARC-Co, or EARC-Co, and ARC-Co Adjustment, or ARC-CA.

## Files
The input files are stored in the folder all_arc. All need to be uploaded when using google colab.

## Code
The code is titled ARC Visualization. It is designed to run in google colab, but functions wherever you use python.
The order of visualizations is (1) ARC-Co payments from 2014-2022, (2) Projected EARC-Co payments from 2014-2022, and (3) Projected ARC-CA payments from 2014-2022
The code includes downloadable options at the end if the user wants to keep or use the maps they have chosen.
