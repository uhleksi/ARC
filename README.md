# ARC
## This is a repository containing all of the data materials I used when writing my thesis and designing the web tool for visualizaiton. My thesis generally covers a redesign of Agricultural Risk Coverage - County, or ARC-Co, a U.S. farm policy commodity support program. The two redesign options are called Enhanced ARC-Co, or EARC-Co, and ARC-Co Adjustment, or ARC-CA.

## Files
The input files are stored in the folder all_arc. All need to be uploaded when using google colab.

## Code
The code is titled thesis.ipynb. It is designed to run in google colab, but it functions wherever you use python.
The code includes downloadable options at the end if the user wants to keep or use the maps they have chosen.
